### A collection of things that might be useful when working with me.

My personal philosphy: 
 > Embrace who _you_ are. Life is precious and infinitely fascinating, so why bother wasting ur short existence by putting on a mask?

 > Always be in pursuit of personal and professional excellence. Reach for _your_ stars, you only have one chance.

 > Be curious. Never stop asking, and never stop listening.
