# Working with Marc

*Date of birth: August 2025 <sub>(No. Not talking about me)</sub>*

*<sub>Status: single. /s</sub>  Document Status: Living, get a first glance at me. Changing as I do.*

## A collection of things that might be useful when working with me.

### My personal philosphy: 
 > Embrace who _you_ are. Life is precious and infinitely fascinating, so why bother wasting ur short existence by putting on a mask?

 > Always be in pursuit of personal and professional excellence. Reach for _your_ stars, you only have one chance.

 > Be curious. Never stop asking, and never stop listening.

### Things to know: 

- As of now, I am a committed office worker. Personally, I find it hard to be productive in my personal space - perhaps because my "home office" is my bedroom...
- I am based in Essen, Germany. During my internship phases, you will most likely find me there. I love to travel, and therefore I will pursuit every opportunity that arises, including business trips and semesters/ internship phases abroad. New settings allow me to reinvent myself and further shape my personality.
- I am not an early bird, but I try to be. Thats why I aim to be in the office by 8:30am ðŸ•£ and leave by 5:30 pmðŸ• . If possible, I prefer to cut 2 hours off on Fridays.
     - As the border between work and life vanishes, so does my behavior. I try to seperate the two (which itself is almost impossible, not connoting that negatively!), but if something does not leave my mind, I *will* send that message at 11pm. *Do not* feel obligated to answer, if you happen to notice it. Its just for my own sanity.
     - Therefore, you will almost always catch me on my work phone aswell. And because I am only a dual student, there is nothing exceptionally urgent I will be needed for :p.
   
- I love making new connections. Depending on my mood, I may be a bit much. If I am: please tell me! I will not be offended. I love to talk. After the ice breaks, I am quite unstoppable. Sometimes its inevitable that I will drift to irrelevant topics or get lost in my own train of thought. And if I should  interrupt you (and I really dont want to appear rude), don't bother saying that I did.
- Sometimes in meetings, especially when it is about new stuff, I will just ~shut up~ be quiet and listen. Please do not interpret it wrong when I am not asking questions. If I feel like there is no specific direction I wanna proceed into, I will just absorb first!
- I am a humorous person. Humor is, in a sense, edgy, so if I ever cross your personal boundaries, say so. I would never intentionally hurt anybodys feelings/ offend anyone. Also I am adjusting myself to the impression I have of you, to prevent incidents from happening!
- I really value tansparency and communication. You can always be honest to me. I am not judgemental, because there is always much more than just the surface (you wouldnt just eat a burger bun, would u?) to almost anything. In the end, you always just interpret everything. And so do they.
